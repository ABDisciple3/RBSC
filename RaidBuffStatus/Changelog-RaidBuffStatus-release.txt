RaidBuffStatus:
- Ported from Ace2 to Ace3 framework.  Ace3 is faster and uses less memory and provides nice config widgets.
- You can now alt-click on tanks missing thorns to automatically buff just like the party buffs.
- Reworked buff checking to be faster and also to not check buffs that are not displayed during combat.
- Raid scanning is now rate-limited so combat action will not cause lots of CPU usage.
- Ace 2 Aura-Special-Events library (seemingly-no-longer-maintained) has been replaced with a few lines of my own code.
- Fixed taint error on clicking on self buffs during combat.
- Corrected Rumsy Rum Black Label spell id.
- The few remaining spells referenced by name are now by number for speed.
- Fixed a long standing bug where if you were the same class as somone who was offline you might be skipped for buff checking.
- Added the option to report to some different channels.
- Added an option to allow you to configure the number of buff columns and hense the width and height.
- Implemented my own minimal replacement for Ace 2 Gratuity library.
